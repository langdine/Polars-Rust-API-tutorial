# Series

A `Series` is a data structure used to store fields, containing all elements of a field with the requirement that all elements are of the same type. Essentially, a `Series` is a `ChunkedArray`, which is an array stored in chunks. In Polars, data within a `Series` is stored in the form of chunks, where each chunk is an independent array. This design enhances data processing efficiency, especially during large-scale data operations, as chunked data can be processed in parallel.
